This is the public C interface to the ODE library.

All these files should be includable from C, i.e. they should not use any C++ features. Everything should be protected with:

	#ifdef __cplusplus
	extern "C" {
	#endif

	...

	#ifdef __cplusplus
	}
	#endif

The only exceptions are the odecpp.h and odecpp_collisioh.h files, which define a C++ wrapper for the C interface. 

Remember to keep this in sync!
